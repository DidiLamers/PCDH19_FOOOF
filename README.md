# PCDH19_FOOOF
 
This is the FOOOF algorithm developed by Haller et al. 2018.

All functions in this folder are developed by Haller et al., only the fooof_complete_didi.m script is my code, containing my implementation of it.

I used FOOOF in my thesis work to find the slope of power spectra of my LFP data.

A detailed description of my implementation of FOOOF can be found in the comments on top of the fooof_complete_didi.m script.
